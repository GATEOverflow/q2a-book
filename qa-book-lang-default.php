		'ack' => '<p> <a href="http://gateoverflow.in">GATE Overflow</a> was started just a year ago and a lot of people have dedicated their time and effort in bringing this book now. Initiated by <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/Omesh+Pandita">Omesh Pandita</a> and <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/arjun">Arjun Suresh</a> as a Q/A platform for CSE students, <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/Kathleen">Kathleen</a> was instrumental in geting all previous year GATE questions here. Then experts like <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/Praveen+Saini">Praven Saini</a>, <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/Happy+Mittal">Happy Mittal</a>, <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/Sankaranarayanan+P.N">Sankaranarayanan</a>, <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/suraj">Suraj</a> etc. have contributed a lot to the answers here. <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/Pragy+Agarwal">Pragy Agarwal</a> even after topping GATE has continuously contributed here with his knowledge as well as in making the contents beautiful with fine latex skills.

The list of all the contributors can be found <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/users">here</a> but even that do not include the contributions of some like Arif Ali in helping design this book, <a href="http://gateoverflow.in/user/Arvind+Devaraj">Arvind Devaraj</a> and others who have provided guidance and help etc. Last but not the least, we thank all the users of GATE Overflow. </p>',
